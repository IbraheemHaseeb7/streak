# 3 Hour Challenge

The challenge was to build a Crud Application with a little complexity using a SQL database within 3 hours. The challenge was completed in 2H 54M. The application is fairly standard following the good practices. Further changes are most welcome into the database.

The database reads and writes are entirely done using raw SQL without the use of any ORM as sqlite3orm is fairly unstable. Perhaps this project can lead to the development of ORM for sqlite 3 that is stable and fully functional.

The challenge was fun and opened the gates of new learning for me personally. Would love to work on more such challenges.

If you see some new content below this line, it means that changes have been made into the project after completing the challenge to further take it to new levels.

I am adding a CI/CD pipeline for learning.
